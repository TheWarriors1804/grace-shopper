    description: `The Silhouette is a 26' x 8' tiny house that balances rustic charm and industrial chic seamlessly. This home was designed with the panoramic views of Vermont in mind. Two massive fixed windows in the living area and an oversized round window in the shower area will make you feel like you're living as close to the great outdoors as possible. This home is as crammed full of customizations on the outside as it is on the inside. Take a hot shower outdoors with the swiveling outdoor shower made of exposed copper. Skip the gym and get your Crossfit workout on right in your own living room with a custom olympic squat/bench rack and gymnastics rings hanging from the ceiling. Sit down in the custom reading nook by the wood burning stove to read your favorite book. Step into the kitchen and notice the folding prep space and custom chopping board sink insert that nests in the fireclay farmhouse sink or hangs on the wall. Enjoy a long hot shower after a day hiking or skiing in the oversized shower with custom doors and tile and endless hot water from the Stiebel Eltron electric tankless hot water heater. This gorgeous home blurs the line between form and function and is the definition of affordable custom luxury. This home costs $89,500 as pictured. If you're interested in owning your own version of The Silhouette get in touch with us through our contact page.`,

This sleek and modern tiny house won't stand up to canon balls like the Civil War ships that inspired its name, but the 40-year warranty metal siding and roofing are incredibly durable and low maintenance. Step inside and you'll find the interior has a modern feel with industrial and rustic accents. White shiplap walls, light natural pine ceiling, and subway tiles are offset by the brooding and dark tone of the trim, hardware, fixtures, and floor. The Ironclad tiny home also has a larger than standard bathroom, large shower (48"x32"), and full sized appliances which allow the space to feel and operate like a much larger home. The cost of the Ironclad as pictured is around $69,000. If you want your very own custom version, contact us here!`,

This 24' tiny home shares some rustic DNA with our original Wind River Bungalow, but with a modern twist. It features a traditional gable roof, maxed out loft dormers, and a small front porch.  The interior has a modern/rustic feel with subtle industrial tweaks. The layout is open and spacious and gives it a bright airy feel with white ship lap walls and custom wood accent finishes.  There is also a large exterior closet located on the hitch end of the home which houses the breaker box, electric tankless hot water heater, and a ton of space for gear (there's even room for a bike). This gorgeous tiny is one of our most affordable models to date and can be purchased as pictured for $59,500. Contact us if you'd like your very own Acadia.`,
